* For FP7, screenshots should be a requirement.
* Renumber so FPLive1 and FPLive2 are just numbered consecutively in order with other assignments and due dates.
* FP8 could be worth more than 8/30. Maybe 10 or 12. Releases and other such things should be worth 1 or 2 pts.
* Don't let your sole job be "GUI monkey." It's quite difficult to strongly represent the ideas of the course if all you're doing is building the GUI.
* Modify the FP8 example to identify which file has which code.
* Show examples of poor use of set!
* Make point that using `append` in an iterative recursion is inefficient in time (lots of `cons`'ing -- way more than a recursive recursion), and that for building lists, _recursive recursion is more efficient_.
